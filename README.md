# Crazy 8's Game Rules

## Overview
Crazy 8's is a card game similar to Uno, played with a standard 52-card deck. The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards and avoid being the last player remaining across multiple rounds.

## Setup
- **Players**: 2-4 players
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Starting Hand**: Each player receives 8 cards
- **Draw Pile**: Remaining cards form the draw pile (face down)
- **Discard Pile**: Turn over the top card of the draw pile to start the discard pile (face up)

## Basic Gameplay

### Turn Order
Play proceeds clockwise around the table, unless reversed by a Queen card.

### Playing Cards
On your turn, you must play a card that matches either:
- **The suit** of the top card on the discard pile, OR
- **The number/rank** of the top card on the discard pile

If you cannot play a card, you must draw one card from the draw pile. If the drawn card can be played, you may play it immediately. If not, your turn ends.

### Winning a Round
The first player to play all their cards is "safe" and advances to the next round. Play continues until only one player has cards remaining - that player is eliminated.

## Special Cards

### Jack - Skip
- The next player loses their turn
- Play continues to the player after the skipped player

### Queen - Reverse
- Reverses the direction of play
- In a 2-player game, acts as a Skip

### Ace - Draw Four (+4)
- The next player must draw 4 cards from the draw pile
- **Stacking Rule**: Can be countered by playing another Ace (any suit) or a 2 of the same suit
- Effects stack: Multiple Aces/2s increase the total cards to be drawn

### 2 - Draw Two (+2)
- The next player must draw 2 cards from the draw pile
- **Stacking Rule**: Can be countered by playing another 2 (any suit) or an Ace of the same suit
- Effects stack: Multiple 2s/Aces increase the total cards to be drawn

### 8 - Wild Card
- Can be played on any card
- Player declares the new suit for the discard pile
- Next player must match the declared suit or play another special card

### All Other Cards (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, King)
- No special effects
- Must follow normal matching rules

## Card Stacking Rules

### Basic Stacking
You can play multiple cards of the same rank in a single turn if:
- The **bottom card** matches the suit or rank of the top discard pile card
- All **additional cards** have the same rank as the bottom card
- There is no limit to how many cards you can stack

**Example**: If a 7 of Spades is on the discard pile, you can play a 7 of Hearts (bottom) + 7 of Clubs + 7 of Diamonds in one turn.

### Special Card Stacking
- **Aces and 2s**: Can only be stacked with other Aces/2s of the **same suit**
- **Draw effects stack**: Each additional Ace adds +4, each additional 2 adds +2

## Draw Card Mechanics

### Carrying Over Effects
When an Ace (+4) is played:
- The next player can avoid drawing by playing:
  - Another Ace (any suit) or matching 2 of the same suit

When an 2 (+2) is played:
- The next player can avoid drawing by playing:
  - Another 2 (any suit) or matching Ace of the same suit (for 2s)

Effects accumulate until someone cannot or chooses not to counter

### Drawing Cards
- Players **must** draw the accumulated total if they cannot counter
- Players **may choose** to draw even if they have a valid counter card
- After drawing, the player can play their drawn cards. 

**Example**: Player A plays Ace of Spades (+4) → Player B plays Ace of Hearts (+4, total now +8) → Player C plays 2 of Hearts (+2, total now +10) → Player D has no valid counter and draws 10 cards.

## Tournament Format

### Elimination Rounds
1. Players who empty their hands first are "safe" and advance to the next round
2. The last player with cards is eliminated
3. Safe players start a new round with 8 fresh cards
4. Continue until only one player remains - they are the winner

### Round Progression
- Round continues until all but one player have emptied their hands
- Eliminated players do not participate in subsequent rounds
- Winner is the sole survivor of the final round

## Additional Rules

### Empty Draw Pile
If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile (except the top card) to form a new draw pile.

### Invalid Plays
If a player makes an invalid play, they must take back their cards and draw one penalty card.
